## Recommendations


- For the highest-selling product in companies, I try to maintain its percentage by increasing it in the branches.
- I provide products according to the month in which they are sold a lot.
- I am trying to find ads that target the category that uses these products.
- I make offers where I put the most used product with a less used product, and thus I end up selling two products, not one.
- I am trying to run a contest for a product that was working for a while and then went down and then it will work again
